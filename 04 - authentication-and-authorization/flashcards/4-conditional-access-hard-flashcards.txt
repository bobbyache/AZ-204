What is one of the ways Conditional Access in Azure Active Directory can be used?|Conditional Access can be used to secure apps and protect services.
What are some ways in which Conditional Access can protect services?|Conditional Access can protect services through multifactor authentication, allowing only Intune enrolled devices, and restricting user locations and IP ranges.
In what cases does Conditional Access require code changes to handle challenges?|Conditional Access requires code changes in scenarios such as apps performing the on-behalf-of flow, apps accessing multiple services/resources, single-page apps using MSAL.js, and web apps calling a resource.
Can Conditional Access policies be applied to both the app and the web API it accesses?|Yes, Conditional Access policies can be applied to both the app and the web API.
When should challenge handling be implemented in an app?|Challenge handling should be implemented to ensure the app continues functioning when a new Conditional Access policy is applied.
What are some scenarios where Conditional Access requires code changes?|Conditional Access requires code changes in scenarios such as multifactor authentication for a single-tenant iOS app, accessing a downstream API through a middle-tier service, and using single-page apps with MSAL.js.
How does Conditional Access affect a single-tenant iOS app without API access?|When a Conditional Access policy is applied, the user of the app needs to perform multifactor authentication upon signing in.
What happens when an enterprise customer applies a policy to a downstream API used by an app?|When a policy is applied, the middle tier of the app performing on-behalf-of flow receives a claims "challenge" and sends it back to the app, which needs to comply with the Conditional Access policy.
What is the purpose of the Conditional Access feature in Azure Active Directory?|The purpose of Conditional Access is to secure apps and protect services.
Name three ways in which Conditional Access can protect services.|Conditional Access can protect services through multifactor authentication, Intune device enrollment restrictions, and user location/IP range restrictions.
What are the scenarios that require code changes to handle Conditional Access challenges?|Scenarios requiring code changes include apps performing the on-behalf-of flow, apps accessing multiple services/resources, single-page apps using MSAL.js, and web apps calling a resource.
Can a Conditional Access policy be applied only to the app or only to the web API?|Yes, a Conditional Access policy can be applied to either the app, the web API, or both.
When should challenge handling be implemented in relation to Conditional Access policies?|Challenge handling should be implemented to ensure the app continues functioning when a new Conditional Access policy is applied.
Give an example of a scenario where Conditional Access requires code changes.|An example scenario is a single-tenant iOS app implementing multifactor authentication with Conditional Access.
What happens when a Conditional Access policy is applied to a downstream API used by an app?|When a policy is applied, the middle tier of the app performs the on-behalf-of flow and receives a claims "challenge" that needs to be handled.
What is one advantage of using Conditional Access for multifactor authentication in a single-tenant iOS app?|An advantage is that the user is prompted to perform multifactor authentication automatically upon signing in.
How does Conditional Access impact a web app calling a resource?|Conditional Access may require code changes in the web app to handle challenges presented when accessing the resource.
