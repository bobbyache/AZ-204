# Summary

The original content explains the key components of Azure Event Hubs. It introduces the Event Hubs client, which is the primary interface for interacting with Event Hubs. It describes the roles of Event Hubs producer and consumer, where producers serve as sources of data and consumers read and process the information. The concept of partitions is explained, which organize data and enable parallelism for event consumers. Consumer groups are introduced as separate views of the event stream, allowing multiple applications to read independently. The content also mentions event receivers, throughput units, and the delivery mechanisms used in Event Hubs.

# Term Dictionary

### Event Consumers vs Event Receivers

In Azure Event Hubs, an event receiver and an event consumer refer to slightly different concepts.

An event receiver is a lower-level concept that represents a client or component that connects to an Event Hub and receives events from one or more partitions. It is responsible for establishing a connection, receiving events, and managing the checkpointing process to track the progress of event consumption.

On the other hand, an event consumer is a higher-level concept that refers to an application or component that consumes or processes events from an Event Hub. It typically utilizes one or more event receivers to retrieve events from partitions and perform specific processing logic on the received events.

In summary, an event receiver is a component that handles the low-level communication and retrieval of events from partitions, while an event consumer is a higher-level application or component that consumes and processes events using one or more event receivers.
