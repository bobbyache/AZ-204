What are the two methods to enable Application Insights?	Application Insights can be enabled through either Auto-Instrumentation (agent) or by adding the Application Insights SDK to your application code.
What is the preferred instrumentation method for enabling Application Insights?	Auto-instrumentation is the preferred instrumentation method for enabling Application Insights. It requires no developer investment and eliminates future overhead related to updating the SDK. It's also the only way to instrument an application in which you don't have access to the source code.
What is required to enable auto-instrumentation for Application Insights?	To enable auto-instrumentation, you need to enable and, in some cases, configure the agent, which collects the telemetry automatically.
When should you install the Application Insights SDK?	You should install the Application Insights SDK in the following circumstances:\n- When you require custom events and metrics\n- When you require control over the flow of telemetry\n- When auto-instrumentation isn't available (typically due to language or platform limitations)
How do you use the Application Insights SDK?	To use the Application Insights SDK, you install a small instrumentation package in your app and then instrument the web app, any background components, and JavaScript within the web pages. The instrumentation monitors your app and directs the telemetry data to an Application Insights resource using a unique token.
Which languages and technologies are natively supported by the Application Insights SDKs?	The Application Insights SDKs for .NET, .NET Core, Java, Node.js, and JavaScript all support distributed tracing natively.
How can any technology be tracked manually with Application Insights?	Any technology can be tracked manually with a call to TrackDependency on the TelemetryClient.
What is OpenCensus and how does it relate to Application Insights?	OpenCensus is an open source, vendor-agnostic distribution of libraries that provides metrics collection and distributed tracing for services. In addition to the Application Insights SDKs, Application Insights also supports distributed tracing through OpenCensus. It enables the open source community to enable distributed tracing with popular technologies like Redis, Memcached, or MongoDB.
