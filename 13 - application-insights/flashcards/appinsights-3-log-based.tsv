What can you analyze using Application Insights log-based metrics?	The health of your monitored apps.
What can you create using Application Insights log-based metrics?	Powerful dashboards.
How are log-based metrics translated into Kusto queries?	Log-based metrics behind the scenes are translated into Kusto queries from stored events.
What type of metrics are stored as pre-aggregated time series?	Standard metrics.
Why do standard metrics have better performance at query time?	Standard metrics are pre-aggregated during collection, which improves their performance at query time.
What are log-based metrics superior for?	Log-based metrics are the superior option for data analysis and ad-hoc diagnostics due to their higher number of dimensions.
How can you switch between log-based and standard metrics in metrics explorer?	Use the namespace selector to switch between log-based and standard metrics in metrics explorer.
How can developers send events to Application Insights?	Developers can use the SDK to send events manually or rely on the automatic collection of events from auto-instrumentation.
What is the role of Application Insights blades in the Azure portal?	Application Insights blades in the Azure portal act as an analytical and diagnostic tool for visualizing event-based data from logs.
What value does retaining a complete set of events using logs bring?	Retaining a complete set of events using logs brings great analytical and diagnostic value, improving visibility into application health and usage.
What techniques does Application Insights implement to reduce telemetry volume?	Application Insights implements several telemetry volume reduction techniques, such as sampling and filtering.
How are pre-aggregated metrics stored?	Pre-aggregated metrics are stored as pre-aggregated time series with key dimensions.
What are the benefits of pre-aggregated metrics at query time?	Pre-aggregated metrics offer faster data retrieval and require less compute power, enabling scenarios such as near real-time alerting and responsive dashboards.
How are pre-aggregated metrics referred to in the Application Insights UX?	In the Application Insights UX, pre-aggregated metrics are called "Standard metrics (preview)."
What SDK versions implement pre-aggregation of metrics during collection?	The newer SDKs (Application Insights 2.7 SDK or later for .NET) implement pre-aggregation of metrics during collection.
What is the advantage of pre-aggregating metrics during collection?	Pre-aggregating metrics during collection reduces data ingestion and lowers cost.
How are pre-aggregated metrics populated for SDKs that don't implement pre-aggregation?	The Application Insights backend populates the pre-aggregated metrics by aggregating the events received through the event collection endpoint.
Does ingestion sampling impact the accuracy of pre-aggregated metrics?	No, ingestion sampling does not impact the accuracy of pre-aggregated metrics.
