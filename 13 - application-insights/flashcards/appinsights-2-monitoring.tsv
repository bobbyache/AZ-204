What types of data does Application Insights collect?	Application Insights collects Metrics and application Telemetry data, including request rates, response times, failure rates, dependency rates, exceptions, page views, AJAX calls, user and session counts, performance counters, host diagnostics, diagnostic trace logs, and custom events and metrics.
How can you find out the most popular pages, response times, and failure rates using Application Insights?	By analyzing the request rates, response times, and failure rates, you can identify the most popular pages, their performance at different times of the day, and the geographical distribution of your users. You can also determine if high response times and failure rates are related to increased request volumes, indicating a possible resourcing problem.
What can you learn from analyzing dependency rates, response times, and failure rates in Application Insights?	By examining the dependency rates, response times, and failure rates, you can assess whether external services are impacting your application's performance and identify any slowdowns caused by those services.
How does Application Insights handle exceptions?	Application Insights allows you to analyze aggregated statistics on exceptions, as well as drill down into specific instances to examine the stack trace and related requests. It reports both server and browser exceptions, providing valuable insights into application errors.
What can you track regarding page views and load performance using Application Insights?	Application Insights can track page views and load performance, providing data reported by users' browsers. This information helps you understand how users interact with your web pages and evaluate their performance.
How does Application Insights capture AJAX calls from web pages?	Application Insights monitors the rates, response times, and failure rates of AJAX calls made from web pages, giving you visibility into the performance and reliability of these asynchronous requests.
What can you track regarding users and sessions using Application Insights?	Application Insights provides user and session counts, allowing you to analyze user engagement and behavior patterns within your application.
What types of performance counters can you collect from your server machines using Application Insights?	Application Insights can collect performance counters from your Windows or Linux server machines, including CPU usage, memory usage, and network usage. These counters provide insights into the overall performance and resource utilization of your servers.
How can you collect host diagnostics using Application Insights?	Application Insights can gather host diagnostics from Docker or Azure, enabling you to monitor and analyze the health and performance of your hosted environments.
How can you correlate trace events with requests using Application Insights?	Application Insights captures diagnostic trace logs from your app, allowing you to correlate trace events with specific requests. This correlation helps in identifying the cause of issues and debugging application behavior.
Can you track custom events and metrics using Application Insights?	Yes, Application Insights allows you to track custom events and metrics that you define in your client or server code. This capability enables you to monitor and measure business-specific events, such as items sold or games won.
How can you start monitoring and analyzing app performance with Application Insights?	You can start monitoring and analyzing app performance in several ways, such as instrumenting your web app at runtime, adding Application Insights to your code during development, instrumenting your web pages for client-side telemetry, integrating with Visual Studio App Center for analyzing mobile app usage, and performing availability tests by pinging your website regularly from Application Insights servers.
Is there a cost associated with using Application Insights?	If you choose the basic pricing plan of Application Insights, there's no charge until your application has grown to have substantial usage. It's free to sign up and get started with Application Insights.
