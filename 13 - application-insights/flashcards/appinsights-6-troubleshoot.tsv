What does the Application Map help you identify?	The Application Map helps you spot performance bottlenecks or failure hotspots across all components of your distributed application.
What does each node on the map represent?	Each node on the map represents an application component or its dependencies and has health KPI and alerts status.
What can you find by clicking through from any component on the map?	By clicking through from any component, you can access more detailed diagnostics, such as Application Insights events.
What additional diagnostics can you access if your app uses Azure services?	If your app uses Azure services, you can also click through to Azure diagnostics, such as SQL Database Advisor recommendations.
What is the definition of components in the context of a distributed/microservices application?	Components are independently deployable parts of your distributed/microservices application that developers and operations teams have code-level visibility or access to telemetry generated by.
How are components different from "observed" external dependencies?	Components are different from "observed" external dependencies because your team/organization may not have access to the code or telemetry of these external dependencies, such as SQL or Event Hubs.
Where can components run?	Components can run on any number of server/role/container instances.
How are components represented in terms of Application Insights instrumentation keys?	Components can be separate Application Insights instrumentation keys (even if subscriptions are different) or different roles reporting to a single Application Insights instrumentation key.
What does the preview map experience show?	The preview map experience shows the components regardless of how they're set up, whether they are different Application Insights resources or different roles in a single resource.
How does the application map discover components?	The application map starts with progressive discovery of the components by triggering a set of queries to discover the components related to a specific component.
What happens when you click "Update map components"?	When you click "Update map components," the map is refreshed with all components discovered until that point, providing a comprehensive view of your application's topology.
What is one of the key objectives of the Application Map experience?	One of the key objectives of the Application Map experience is to visualize complex topologies with hundreds of components.
How can you access related insights and the performance and failure triage experience for a specific component?	By clicking on any component on the map, you can access related insights and go to the performance and failure triage experience for that component.
How does Application Map identify the components on the map?	Application Map uses the cloud role name property to identify the components on the map, and you can manually set or override the cloud role name to change what gets displayed.
