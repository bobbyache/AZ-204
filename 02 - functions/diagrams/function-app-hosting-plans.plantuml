**** Fully isolated and dedicated environment
**** Securely runs App Service apps at high scale
*** Kubernetes (Direct or Azure Arc)
**** Fully isolated and dedicated environment
**** Runs on top of the Kubernetes platform
** Scaling Behaviors
*** Consumption Plan and Premium Plan
**** Automatic scaling based on trigger events or invocations
*** Dedicated Plan and ASE
**** Manual or autoscaling (max instances: 10-100)
*** Kubernetes
**** Event-driven autoscaling using KEDA
**** Max instances vary by cluster
** Maximum Scale-out Capacity
*** Varies by region and hosting plan
*** Refer to Premium plan article and App Service plan limits for details
** functionTimeout Property
*** Specifies timeout duration for function executions
** Azure Storage Account
*** Required for trigger management and logging
