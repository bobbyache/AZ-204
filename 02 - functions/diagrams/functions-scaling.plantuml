* Azure Functions Scaling
** Consumption Plan
*** CPU and memory scale by adding host instances
*** Each instance has 1.5 GB memory and one CPU
*** Function apps within a plan scale independently
** Premium Plan
*** Memory and CPU based on plan size
*** All apps in a plan share resources on an instance
** Function Code Files
*** Stored on Azure Files shares
*** Deletion of main storage account is irreversible
** Scale Controller
*** Monitors event rate and triggers scaling
*** Scaling behavior based on trigger type
** Unit of Scale
*** Function app is scaled out or in
*** Multiple instances of Functions host allocated
*** Instances scaled in to zero when no functions running
** Scaling Behavior
*** Maximum instances: 200 per function app
*** No set limit on concurrent executions
*** New instance rate: HTTP (once per second), non-HTTP (once every 30 seconds)
** Restricting Maximum Instances
*** Modify functionAppScaleLimit
*** Default: Consumption (200 instances), Premium (100 instances)
*** Set lower maximum value or 0/null for unrestricted scaling
