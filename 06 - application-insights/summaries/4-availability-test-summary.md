# Summary 

The original content discusses the importance of monitoring the availability and responsiveness of web applications or websites. It introduces Application Insights as a tool that sends web requests to the application from various locations worldwide at regular intervals to check its performance. The availability tests can be set up for any HTTP or HTTPS endpoint accessible from the public internet, including REST APIs. There are three types of availability tests: URL ping test, Standard test, and Custom TrackAvailability test. The URL ping test validates endpoint response and performance, while the Standard test includes additional features like SSL certificate validity and custom headers. Custom TrackAvailability tests allow sending results to Application Insights through a custom application. The content also mentions Multi-step tests for complex scenarios and the reliance of URL ping tests on public DNS infrastructure. Private DNS can be resolved using custom TrackAvailability tests.
