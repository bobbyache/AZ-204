What guarantee does strong consistency offer?|Strong consistency offers linearizability guarantee, ensuring that reads return the most recent committed version of an item. Uncommitted or partial writes are never seen.
What does bounded staleness consistency guarantee?|Bounded staleness consistency guarantees that reads honor the consistent-prefix guarantee. Reads may lag behind writes by a specified number of versions or a time interval.
What guarantees does session consistency provide?|Session consistency ensures that within a single client session, reads honor consistent-prefix, monotonic reads, monotonic writes, read-your-writes, and write-follows-reads guarantees.
What is consistent prefix consistency?|Consistent prefix consistency provides eventual consistency for single document writes and consistency for batch writes within a transaction. Write operations within a transaction of multiple documents are always visible together.
What is eventual consistency?|Eventual consistency offers no ordering guarantee for reads. Replicas eventually converge, and clients may read values older than previously read values.
What are the simple considerations to choose the right consistency level in Azure Cosmos DB?|The simple considerations to choose the right consistency level in Azure Cosmos DB are: Each consistency model provides specific availability and performance tradeoffs, and Azure Cosmos DB guarantees 100 percent consistency for the chosen level.
What is the default consistency level and how can it be configured in Azure Cosmos DB?|The default consistency level can be configured on an Azure Cosmos DB account. It applies to all databases and containers under that account, and all reads and queries use this level by default.
What does strong consistency guarantee in Azure Cosmos DB?|Strong consistency offers linearizability guarantee, ensuring that reads return the most recent committed version of an item. Uncommitted or partial writes are never seen.
What is bounded staleness consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|Bounded staleness consistency guarantees that reads honor the consistent-prefix guarantee. Reads may lag behind writes by a specified number of versions or a time interval.
What guarantees does session consistency provide in Azure Cosmos DB?|Session consistency guarantees that within a single client session, reads honor consistent-prefix, monotonic reads, monotonic writes, read-your-writes, and write-follows-reads guarantees.
What is consistent prefix consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|Consistent prefix consistency provides eventual consistency for single document writes, and consistency for batch writes within a transaction. Write operations within a transaction of multiple documents are always visible together.
What is eventual consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|Eventual consistency offers no ordering guarantee for reads. Replicas eventually converge, and clients may read values older than previously read values.
What does strong consistency guarantee in Azure Cosmos DB?|Strong consistency in Azure Cosmos DB offers linearizability guarantee. It ensures that reads return the most recent committed version of an item, and clients never see uncommitted or partial writes.
What is the benefit of strong consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|The benefit of strong consistency is that users are always guaranteed to read the latest committed write. It provides a high level of data accuracy and integrity.
How does strong consistency handle concurrent requests in Azure Cosmos DB?|Strong consistency serves requests concurrently, ensuring that each read operation sees the most recent committed version of an item. It maintains strict ordering and eliminates conflicts.
Does strong consistency impact availability or performance in Azure Cosmos DB?|Strong consistency offers precise availability and performance tradeoffs. While it provides the highest level of consistency, it may have a slight impact on availability and latency compared to weaker consistency models.
What is the underlying concept behind strong consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|The underlying concept behind strong consistency is linearizability. It ensures that the order of operations appears as if they happened sequentially, even in the presence of concurrent requests.
What is bounded staleness consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|Bounded staleness consistency in Azure Cosmos DB guarantees that reads honor the consistent-prefix guarantee. Reads may lag behind writes by a specified number of versions or a time interval.
How does bounded staleness consistency handle the lag between reads and writes?|In bounded staleness consistency, the lag between reads and writes can be configured in two ways: the number of versions (K) of an item or the time interval (T). Reads will lag behind writes by at most K versions or T time, whichever is reached first.
What are the minimum values for K and T in bounded staleness consistency for single region and multi-region accounts?|For a single region account, the minimum value of K and T is 10 write operations or 5 seconds. For multi-region accounts, the minimum value of K and T is 100,000 write operations or 300 seconds.
What are the benefits of using bounded staleness consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|Bounded staleness consistency provides a balance between consistency and performance. It allows for a certain lag between reads and writes, which can improve overall system performance without sacrificing too much consistency.
How does bounded staleness consistency handle consistency guarantees in Azure Cosmos DB?|In bounded staleness consistency, while there may be a lag between reads and writes, the consistent-prefix guarantee is still honored. This means that reads will always see a consistent state of data, although slightly behind the latest updates.
What guarantees does session consistency provide in Azure Cosmos DB?|Session consistency in Azure Cosmos DB guarantees that within a single client session, reads honor consistent-prefix, monotonic reads, monotonic writes, read-your-writes, and write-follows-reads guarantees.
What is the scope of session consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|Session consistency applies within a single client session. It ensures that all reads performed within the same session see a consistent state of the data, preserving the order of writes and reads within that session.
How does session consistency handle multiple writers in Azure Cosmos DB?|In session consistency, multiple writers can share the same session token. As long as there is a single "writer" session or sharing of the session token, the guarantees of consistent-prefix, monotonic reads, monotonic writes, read-your-writes, and write-follows-reads are maintained.
What are the benefits of using session consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|Session consistency provides strong guarantees within a client session, ensuring that reads reflect the most recent writes and maintaining order. It is well-suited for scenarios where strong consistency is needed within a specific user session or application context.
Does session consistency have any impact on performance or availability in Azure Cosmos DB?|Session consistency offers a balance between consistency and performance. While it provides strong guarantees, it may have a slight impact on availability and latency compared to weaker consistency models.
What is consistent prefix consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|Consistent prefix consistency in Azure Cosmos DB provides eventual consistency for single document writes and consistency for batch writes within a transaction. Write operations within a transaction of multiple documents are always visible together.
How does consistent prefix consistency handle single document writes in Azure Cosmos DB?|In consistent prefix consistency, updates made as single document writes see eventual consistency. Each read operation will eventually reflect the latest committed write for that document.
What is the behavior of consistent prefix consistency for batch writes within a transaction in Azure Cosmos DB?|For batch writes within a transaction, consistent prefix consistency ensures that updates made within a transaction are returned consistently to the transaction in which they were committed. Write operations within a transaction involving multiple documents are always visible together.
Does consistent prefix consistency guarantee a specific ordering of operations in Azure Cosmos DB?|Consistent prefix consistency does not guarantee a specific ordering of operations. However, it ensures that updates made within a transaction are returned consistently to that transaction and that write operations within a transaction involving multiple documents are always visible together.
How is consistent prefix consistency different from strong consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|Consistent prefix consistency provides eventual consistency for single document writes and consistency for batch writes within a transaction, while strong consistency guarantees the most recent committed version of an item. Consistent prefix consistency allows for some lag in updates but maintains consistency within transactions.
What is eventual consistency in Azure Cosmos DB?|Eventual consistency in Azure Cosmos DB means that there is no ordering guarantee for reads. In the absence of further writes, replicas eventually converge and reach a consistent state.
What is the characteristic of eventual consistency in terms of ordering guarantees?|Eventual consistency does not provide ordering guarantees for reads. Clients may read values that are older than previously read values, depending on the replication and convergence process.
When is eventual consistency ideal to use in Azure Cosmos DB?|Eventual consistency is ideal in scenarios where the application does not require strict ordering guarantees. It is suitable for scenarios like counting retweets, likes, or non-threaded comments, where real-time consistency is not crucial.
Does eventual consistency offer strong data accuracy and integrity in Azure Cosmos DB?|Eventual consistency is the weakest form of consistency and does not provide strong data accuracy and integrity guarantees. It trades off strict consistency for improved availability and performance.
What is the benefit of eventual consistency in terms of system performance in Azure Cosmos DB?|Eventual consistency allows for higher system performance by relaxing the constraints of immediate consistency. It enables faster reads and writes, as replicas can operate independently and converge over time.
