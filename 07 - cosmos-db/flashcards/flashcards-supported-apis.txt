What are the different database APIs offered by Azure Cosmos DB?|Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL, Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra, Azure Cosmos DB for Table, Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Gremlin.
What are the data models supported by Azure Cosmos DB?|Azure Cosmos DB supports documents, key-value, graph, and column-family data models.
What are the considerations when choosing an API?|Considerations when choosing an API include having existing applications for MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, or Gremlin, not wanting to rewrite the entire data access layer, and wanting to utilize the open-source developer ecosystem, client-drivers, expertise, and resources.
What is the Azure Cosmos DB API for NoSQL used for?|The Azure Cosmos DB API for NoSQL is used to store data in document format and provides full control over the interface, service, and SDK client libraries.
What is the Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB used for?|The Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB is used to store data in a document structure using the BSON format. It is compatible with the MongoDB wire protocol and allows integration with the MongoDB ecosystem.
What is the Azure Cosmos DB API for PostgreSQL used for?|The Azure Cosmos DB API for PostgreSQL is a managed service for running PostgreSQL at any scale, with the ability to distribute tables using the Citus open-source technology.
What is the Azure Cosmos DB API for Apache Cassandra used for?|The Azure Cosmos DB API for Apache Cassandra is used to store data in a column-oriented schema. It provides a highly distributed and horizontally scalable approach to storing large volumes of data.
What is the Azure Cosmos DB API for Apache Gremlin used for?|The Azure Cosmos DB API for Apache Gremlin allows users to make graph queries and store data as edges and vertices. It is suitable for scenarios involving dynamic data, complex relations, and data that cannot be easily modeled with relational databases.
What is the Azure Cosmos DB API for Table used for?|The Azure Cosmos DB API for Table is used to store data in a key/value format. It is recommended for migrating from Azure Table storage to overcome limitations in latency, scaling, throughput, global distribution, index management, and query performance. It supports only OLTP scenarios.
