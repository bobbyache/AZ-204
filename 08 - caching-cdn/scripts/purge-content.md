# Purge CDN Content

- [Source is here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/develop-for-storage-cdns/3-control-cache-behavior)

You can purge content in several ways.
- 
- On an endpoint by endpoint basis, or all endpoints simultaneously should you want to update everything on your CDN at once.
- Specify a file, by including the path to that file or all assets on the selected endpoint by checking the Purge All checkbox in the Azure portal.
- Based on wildcards (*) or using the root (/).

```bash
az cdn endpoint purge \
    --content-paths '/css/*' '/js/app.js' \
    --name ContosoEndpoint \
    --profile-name DemoProfile \
    --resource-group ExampleGroup
```

You can also preload assets into an endpoint. This is useful for scenarios where your application creates a large number of assets, and you want to improve the user experience by prepopulating the cache before any actual requests occur:

```bash
az cdn endpoint load \
    --content-paths '/img/*' '/js/module.js' \
    --name ContosoEndpoint \
    --profile-name DemoProfile \
    --resource-group ExampleGroup
```
