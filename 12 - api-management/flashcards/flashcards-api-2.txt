Where can policy expressions be used in API Management?|Policy expressions can be used as attribute values or text values in any API Management policy, unless specified otherwise.
What are the different scopes at which policies can be applied in API Management?|Policies can be applied at different scopes, including global (all APIs), a product, a specific API, or an API operation.
What is the role of an API gateway in a solution with multiple front- and back-end services?|An API gateway acts as a mediator between clients and services, handling tasks like request routing, policy enforcement, and data collection.
How does an API gateway help address the issues related to exposing services directly to clients?|An API gateway decouples clients from services, abstracts away complexities, enables easier service refactoring, allows seamless interaction with multiple services, standardizes communication protocols, and consolidates the attack surface for improved security.
What tasks does an API gateway perform for client requests?|An API gateway acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests from clients to services. It can also handle tasks like authentication, SSL termination (secure connections), and rate limiting.
Why is it beneficial to use an API gateway for client interactions with multiple services?|Using an API gateway provides a centralized entry point, decouples clients from service complexities, simplifies service refactoring, enables seamless interaction with multiple services, standardizes communication protocols, improves security, and enhances solution resilience and maintainability.
What are the responsibilities of the API Management gateway (data plane or runtime)?|The API Management gateway is responsible for proxying API requests, applying policies, and collecting telemetry.
What are the potential problems of exposing services directly to clients?|Exposing services directly to clients can result in complex client code, create coupling between the client and the backend, require handling multiple service failures, and limit communication protocols.
What is the role of an API gateway in relation to client and service communication?|An API gateway sits between clients and services, acting as a reverse proxy to route requests from clients to services.
What are some tasks an API gateway can perform in addition to request routing?|An API gateway can handle tasks such as authentication, SSL termination, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting concerns.
How does an API gateway decouple clients from services?|An API gateway abstracts away the complexities of service decomposition, allowing clients to interact with the gateway instead of individual services directly.
What benefits does an API gateway provide for service maintenance and refactoring?|By using an API gateway, service refactoring becomes easier as the client code remains unchanged, reducing the impact of service modifications on clients.
What limitations can be overcome by employing an API gateway?|An API gateway enables services to communicate using client-friendly protocols like HTTP or WebSocket, expanding communication options beyond service-specific protocols.
Why is consolidating the attack surface important in service architectures?|Consolidating the attack surface by using an API gateway reduces the potential points of vulnerability and strengthens the overall security of the solution.
How does an API gateway contribute to solution resilience and maintainability?|An API gateway improves resilience by handling failures and abstracting service complexities. It also enhances maintainability by providing a centralized and standardized entry point for clients.
What are the two types of gateways available in API Management?|The two types of gateways in API Management are managed and self-hosted gateways.
What is the role of the managed gateway in API Management?|The managed gateway is the default gateway component in Azure for every API Management instance. It routes all API traffic through Azure, regardless of the hosting location of the API backends.
What is the self-hosted gateway in API Management used for?|The self-hosted gateway is an optional, containerized version of the managed gateway. It is useful for hybrid and multicloud scenarios where the gateways need to be run outside of Azure, in the same environments as the API backends.
In what scenarios is the self-hosted gateway beneficial?|The self-hosted gateway is beneficial in hybrid and multicloud environments, allowing customers to manage APIs hosted on-premises and across various clouds from a single API Management service in Azure.
What is the advantage of using the managed gateway in API Management?|The managed gateway is the default option and simplifies API traffic routing as all traffic flows through Azure, regardless of the backend hosting location.
How does the self-hosted gateway contribute to hybrid IT infrastructure?|The self-hosted gateway enables customers with hybrid IT infrastructure to manage APIs hosted on-premises and across clouds, providing centralized API management from Azure.
What are policies in Azure API Management?|Policies in Azure API Management allow publishers to modify API behavior through configuration using a collection of statements executed sequentially on API requests or responses.
Where are policies applied in the API Management architecture?|Policies are applied within the API Management gateway, which sits between the API consumer and the managed API.
What can policies modify in API requests and responses?|Policies can modify both inbound requests and outbound responses, allowing changes to be applied to the request and response data.
What is a policy expression?|A policy expression is a C# statement or code block that can be used as an attribute value or text value in API Management policies.
How are policy expressions used to control API behavior?|Policy expressions provide a means to control traffic and modify API behavior without requiring specialized code or backend service modifications.
What are the sections in a policy definition?|A policy definition consists of inbound, backend, outbound, and on-error sections, with a series of statements executed in order for each request and response.
What happens when an error occurs during request processing?|If an error occurs, any remaining steps in the inbound, backend, or outbound sections are skipped, and execution jumps to the on-error section for error handling.
How can policies be ordered when applied at different levels?|Policies at the global and API levels can be combined and ordered using the base element to ensure a deterministic execution order.
How do policy expressions access variables and types?|Policy expressions have access to the context variable and a subset of .NET Framework types for performing operations and transformations.
