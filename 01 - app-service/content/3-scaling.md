Autoscaling enables a system to adjust the resources required to meet the varying demand from users, while controlling the costs associated with these resources. You can use autoscaling with many Azure services, including web applications. Autoscaling requires you to configure autoscale rules that specify the conditions under which resources should be added or removed.

# Examine autoscale factors

Autoscaling can be triggered according to a schedule, or by assessing whether the system is running short on resources. For example, autoscaling could be triggered if CPU utilization grows, memory occupancy increases, the number of incoming requests to a service appears to be surging, or some combination of factors.

## What is autoscaling?
Autoscaling is a cloud system or process that adjusts available resources based on the current demand. Autoscaling performs scaling in and out, as opposed to scaling up and down.

## Azure App Service Autoscaling
Autoscaling in Azure App Service monitors the resource metrics of a web app as it runs. It detects situations where other resources are required to handle an increasing workload, and ensures those resources are available before the system becomes overloaded.

Autoscaling responds to changes in the environment by adding or removing web servers and balancing the load between them. Autoscaling doesn't have any effect on the CPU power, memory, or storage capacity of the web servers powering the app, it only changes the number of web servers.

## Autoscaling rules
Autoscaling makes its decisions based on rules that you define. A rule specifies the threshold for a metric, and triggers an autoscale event when this threshold is crossed. Autoscaling can also deallocate resources when the workload has diminished.

Define your autoscaling rules carefully. For example, a Denial of Service attack will likely result in a large-scale influx of incoming traffic. Trying to handle a surge in requests caused by a DoS attack would be fruitless and expensive. These requests aren't genuine, and should be discarded rather than processed. A better solution is to implement detection and filtering of requests that occur during such an attack before they reach your service.

## When should you consider autoscaling?
Autoscaling provides elasticity for your services. For example, you might expect increased/reduced activity for a business app during holidays.

Autoscaling improves availability and fault tolerance. It can help ensure that client requests to a service won't be denied because an instance is either not able to acknowledge the request in a timely manner, or because an overloaded instance has crashed.

Autoscaling works by adding or removing web servers. If your web apps perform resource-intensive processing as part of each request, then autoscaling might not be an effective approach. In these situations, manually scaling up may be necessary. For example, if a request sent to a web app involves performing complex processing over a large dataset, depending on the instance size, this single request could exhaust the processing and memory capacity of the instance.

Autoscaling isn't the best approach to handling long-term growth. You might have a web app that starts with a few users, but increases in popularity over time. Autoscaling has an overhead associated with monitoring resources and determining whether to trigger a scaling event. In this scenario, if you can anticipate the rate of growth, manually scaling the system over time may be a more cost effective approach.

The number of instances of a service is also a factor. You might expect to run only a few instances of a service most of the time. However, in this situation, your service is susceptible to downtime or lack of availability whether autoscaling is enabled or not. The fewer the number of instances initially, the less capacity you have to handle an increasing workload while autoscaling spins up more instances.

# Identify autoscale factors

Autoscaling enables you to specify the conditions under which a web app should be scaled out, and back in again. Effective autoscaling ensures sufficient resources are available to handle large volumes of requests at peak times, while managing costs when the demand drops.

You can configure autoscaling to detect when to scale in and out according to a combination of factors, based on resource usage. You can also configure autoscaling to occur according to a schedule.

In this unit, you learn how to specify the factors that can be used to autoscale a service.

Autoscaling and the App Service Plan
Autoscaling is a feature of the App Service Plan used by the web app. When the web app scales out, Azure starts new instances of the hardware defined by the App Service Plan to the app.

To prevent runaway autoscaling, an App Service Plan has an instance limit. Plans in more expensive pricing tiers have a higher limit. Autoscaling can't create more instances than this limit.

# Autoscale conditions

You indicate how to autoscale by creating autoscale conditions. Azure provides two options for autoscaling:

- Scale based on a metric, such as the length of the disk queue, or the number of HTTP requests awaiting processing.
- Scale to a specific instance count according to a schedule. For example, you can arrange to scale out at a particular time of day, or on a specific date or day of the week. You also specify an end date, and the system scales back in at this time.
- Scaling to a specific instance count only enables you to scale out to a defined number of instances. If you need to scale out incrementally, you can combine metric and schedule-based autoscaling in the same autoscale condition. So, you could arrange for the system to scale out if the number of HTTP requests exceeds some threshold, but only between certain hours of the day.

You can create multiple autoscale conditions to handle different schedules and metrics. Azure autoscales your service when any of these conditions apply. An App Service Plan also has a default condition that is used if none of the other conditions are applicable. This condition is always active and doesn't have a schedule.

## Metrics for autoscale rules

Autoscaling by metric requires that you define one or more autoscale rules. An autoscale rule specifies a metric to monitor, and how autoscaling should respond when this metric crosses a defined threshold. The metrics you can monitor for a web app are:

- CPU Percentage. This metric is an indication of the CPU utilization across all instances. A high value shows that instances are becoming CPU-bound, which could cause delays in processing client requests.
- Memory Percentage. This metric captures the memory occupancy of the application across all instances. A high value indicates that free memory could be running low, and could cause one or more instances to fail.
- Disk Queue Length. This metric is a measure of the number of outstanding I/O requests across all instances. A high value means that disk contention could be occurring.
- Http Queue Length. This metric shows how many client requests are waiting for processing by the web app. If this number is large, client requests might fail with HTTP 408 (Timeout) errors.
- Data In. This metric is the number of bytes received across all instances.
- Data Out. This metric is the number of bytes sent by all instances.

You can also scale based on metrics for other Azure services. For example, if the web app processes requests received from a Service Bus Queue, you might want to spin up more instances of a web app if the number of items held in an Azure Service Bus Queue exceeds a critical length.

## How an autoscale rule analyzes metrics

Autoscaling works by analyzing trends in metric values over time across all instances. Analysis is a multi-step process.

In the first step, an autoscale rule aggregates the values retrieved for a metric for all instances across a period of time known as the time grain. Each metric has its own intrinsic time grain, but in most cases this period is 1 minute. The aggregated value is known as the time aggregation. The options available are Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, Last, and Count.

An interval of one minute is a short interval in which to determine whether any change in metric is long-lasting enough to make autoscaling worthwhile. So, an autoscale rule performs a second step that performs a further aggregation of the value calculated by the time aggregation over a longer, user-specified period, known as the Duration. The minimum Duration is 5 minutes. If the Duration is set to 10 minutes for example, the autoscale rule aggregates the 10 values calculated for the time grain.

The aggregation calculation for the Duration can be different from the time grain. For example, if the time aggregation is Average and the statistic gathered is CPU Percentage across a one-minute time grain, each minute the average CPU percentage utilization across all instances for that minute is calculated. If the time grain statistic is set to Maximum, and the Duration of the rule is set to 10 minutes, the maximum of the 10 average values for the CPU percentage utilization is to determine whether the rule threshold has been crossed.

## Autoscale actions

When an autoscale rule detects that a metric has crossed a threshold, it can perform an autoscale action. An autoscale action can be scale-out or scale-in. A scale-out action increases the number of instances, and a scale-in action reduces the instance count. An autoscale action uses an operator (such as less than, greater than, equal to, and so on) to determine how to react to the threshold. Scale-out actions typically use the greater than operator to compare the metric value to the threshold. Scale-in actions tend to compare the metric value to the threshold with the less than operator. An autoscale action can also set the instance count to a specific level, rather than incrementing or decrementing the number available.

An autoscale action has a cool down period, specified in minutes. During this interval, the scale rule won't be triggered again. This is to allow the system to stabilize between autoscale events. Remember that it takes time to start up or shut down instances, and so any metrics gathered might not show any significant changes for several minutes. The minimum cool down period is five minutes.

## Pairing autoscale rules

You should plan for scaling-in when a workload decreases. Consider defining autoscale rules in pairs in the same autoscale condition. One autoscale rule should indicate how to scale the system out when a metric exceeds an upper threshold. Then other rule should define how to scale the system back in again when the same metric drops below a lower threshold.

## Combining autoscale rules

A single autoscale condition can contain several autoscale rules (for example, a scale-out rule and the corresponding scale-in rule). However, the autoscale rules in an autoscale condition don't have to be directly related. You could define the following four rules in the same autoscale condition:

- If the HTTP queue length exceeds 10, scale out by 1
- If the CPU utilization exceeds 70%, scale out by 1
- If the HTTP queue length is zero, scale in by 1
- If the CPU utilization drops below 50%, scale in by 1

When determining whether to scale out, the autoscale action is performed if any of the scale-out rules are met (HTTP queue length exceeds 10 or CPU utilization exceeds 70%). When scaling in, the autoscale action runs only if all of the scale-in rules are met (HTTP queue length drops to zero and CPU utilization falls below 50%). If you need to scale in if only one of the scale-in rules are met, you must define the rules in separate autoscale conditions.

# Explore autoscale best practices

If you're not following good practices when creating autoscale settings, you can create conditions that lead to undesirable results. In this unit, you'll learn how to avoid creating rules that conflict with each other.

## Autoscale concepts

An autoscale setting scales instances horizontally, which is out by increasing the instances and in by decreasing the number of instances. An autoscale setting has a maximum, minimum, and default value of instances.

An autoscale job always reads the associated metric to scale by, checking if it has crossed the configured threshold for scale-out or scale-in.

All thresholds are calculated at an instance level. For example, "scale out by one instance when average CPU > 80% when instance count is 2", means to scale out when the average CPU across all instances is greater than 80%.

All autoscale successes and failures are logged to the Activity Log. You can then configure an activity log alert so that you can be notified via email, SMS, or webhooks whenever there's activity.

## Autoscale best practices

Use the following best practices as you create your autoscale rules.

### Ensure the maximum and minimum values are different and have an adequate margin between them

If you have a setting that has minimum=two, maximum=two and the current instance count is two, no scale action can occur. Keep an adequate margin between the maximum and minimum instance counts, which are inclusive. Autoscale always scales between these limits.

### Choose the appropriate statistic for your diagnostics metric

For diagnostics metrics, you can choose among Average, Minimum, Maximum and Total as a metric to scale by. The most common statistic is Average.

### Choose the thresholds carefully for all metric types

We recommend carefully choosing different thresholds for scale-out and scale-in based on practical situations.

We don't recommend autoscale settings like the following examples with the same or similar threshold values for out and in conditions:

- Increase instances by one count when Thread Count >= 600
- Decrease instances by one count when Thread Count <= 600

Let's look at an example of what can lead to a behavior that may seem confusing. Consider the following sequence.

- Assume there are two instances to begin with and then the average number of threads per instance grows to 625.
- Autoscale scales out adding a third instance.
- Next, assume that the average thread count across instance falls to 575.
- Before scaling in, autoscale tries to estimate what the final state will be if it scaled in. For example, 575 x 3 (current instance count) = 1,725 / 2 (final number of instances when scaled in) = 862.5 threads. This means autoscale would have to immediately scale out again even after it scaled in, if the average thread count remains the same or even falls only a small amount. However, if it scaled out again, the whole process would repeat, leading to an infinite loop.
- To avoid this situation (termed "flapping"), autoscale doesn't scale in at all. Instead, it skips and reevaluates the condition again the next time the service's job executes. This can confuse many people because autoscale wouldn't appear to work when the average thread count was 575.

Estimation during a scale-in is intended to avoid "flapping" situations, where scale-in and scale out actions continually go back and forth. Keep this behavior in mind when you choose the same thresholds for scale-out and in.

We recommend choosing an adequate margin between the scale-out and in thresholds. As an example, consider the following better rule combination.

- Increase instances by 1 count when CPU% >= 80
- Decrease instances by 1 count when CPU% <= 60

In this case

- Assume there are 2 instances to start with.
- If the average CPU% across instances goes to 80, autoscale scales out adding a third instance.
- Now assume that over time the CPU% falls to 60.
- Autoscale's scale-in rule estimates the final state if it were to scale-in. For example, 60 x 3 (current instance count) = 180 / 2 (final number of instances when scaled in) = 90. So autoscale doesn't scale-in because it would have to scale out again immediately. Instead, it skips scaling in.
- The next time autoscale checks, the CPU continues to fall to 50. It estimates again - 50 x 3 instance = 150 / 2 instances = 75, which is below the scale-out threshold of 80, so it scales in successfully to 2 instances.

### Considerations for scaling when multiple rules are configured in a profile

There are cases where you may have to set multiple rules in a profile. The following set of autoscale rules are used by services when multiple rules are set.

On scale-out, autoscale runs if any rule is met. On scale-in, autoscale require all rules to be met.

To illustrate, assume that you have the following four autoscale rules:

If CPU < 30%, scale-in by 1
If Memory < 50%, scale-in by 1
If CPU > 75%, scale out by 1
If Memory > 75%, scale out by 1
Then the following occurs:

If CPU is 76% and Memory is 50%, we scale out.
If CPU is 50% and Memory is 76% we scale out.
On the other hand, if CPU is 25% and memory is 51% autoscale doesn't scale-in. An automatic scale-in would occur if the CPU is 29% and the Memory is 49% since both of the scale-in rules would be true.

### Always select a safe default instance count

The default instance count is important because autoscale scales your service to that count when metrics aren't available. Therefore, select a default instance count that's safe for your workloads.

## Configure autoscale notifications
Autoscale posts to the Activity Log if any of the following conditions occur:

- Autoscale issues a scale operation
- Autoscale service successfully completes a scale action
- Autoscale service fails to take a scale action.
- Metrics aren't available for autoscale service to make a scale decision.
- Metrics are available (recovery) again to make a scale decision.

You can also use an Activity Log alert to monitor the health of the autoscale engine. In addition to using activity log alerts, you can also configure email or webhook notifications to get notified for successful scale actions via the notifications tab on the autoscale setting.
