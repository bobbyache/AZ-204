What are the two main categories of pricing tiers for App Service plans?|The two main categories are shared compute and dedicated compute.
Which pricing tiers belong to the dedicated compute category?|The Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, and PremiumV3 tiers belong to the dedicated compute category.
What is the purpose of isolated pricing tiers?|Isolated pricing tiers offer dedicated Azure VMs on dedicated Azure Virtual Networks, providing both compute and network isolation for apps.
How does an app run and scale in the Free and Shared tiers?|In the Free and Shared tiers, an app runs on a shared VM instance and cannot scale out.
How does an app run and scale in other tiers?|In other tiers, an app runs on all the VM instances configured in the App Service plan.
What happens when multiple apps are in the same App Service plan?|Multiple apps in the same plan share the same VM instances.
What about deployment slots? Where do they run?|Deployment slots also run on the same VM instances as the app.
Do diagnostic logs, backups, and WebJobs use resources on VM instances?|Yes, enabling diagnostic logs, performing backups, or running WebJobs utilizes CPU cycles and memory on the VM instances.
What is the scale unit for App Service apps?|The App Service plan serves as the scale unit for App Service apps.
Can the App Service plan be scaled up and down?|Yes, the App Service plan can be scaled up and down by changing the pricing tier.
When should an app be moved into a separate App Service plan?|An app should be moved into a separate App Service plan if it is resource-intensive, needs independent scaling, or requires resources in a different geographical region.
What are the benefits of isolating an app into a new App Service plan?|Isolating an app into a new plan allows for improved performance, independent scaling, and greater control over the app's resources.
Can cost savings be achieved by sharing an App Service plan?|Yes, putting multiple apps into one App Service plan can potentially save money.
What factors should be considered before sharing an App Service plan?|The capacity of the existing plan and the expected load for the new app should be considered before sharing an App Service plan.
What does an App Service plan define?|An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run.
In which pricing tier are apps run on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps?|Shared compute pricing tiers, Free and Shared, run apps on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps, including apps of other customers.
What determines the resources available for an app in an App Service plan?|The pricing tier of an App Service plan determines the App Service features you get and the cost.
How do the Dedicated compute pricing tiers differ from the Shared compute pricing tiers?|Dedicated compute pricing tiers, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, and PremiumV3, run apps on dedicated Azure VMs, while Shared compute pricing tiers share the same Azure VMs among multiple apps.
What additional capabilities does the Isolated pricing tier provide compared to other tiers?|The Isolated pricing tiers, Isolated and IsolatedV2, not only offer dedicated Azure VMs but also provide network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps.
What are the base tiers intended for?|App Service Free and Shared (preview) hosting plans are base tiers intended for development and testing purposes.
In which region are compute resources created when you create an App Service plan?|When you create an App Service plan in a certain region, a set of compute resources is created for that plan in that region.
How many VM instances are available for scale-out in the Dedicated compute pricing tiers?|The higher the Dedicated compute pricing tier, the more VM instances are available for scale-out.
What type of resources do multiple apps in the same App Service plan share?|Multiple apps in the same App Service plan share the same compute resources.
What is provided by the Isolated pricing tiers in addition to compute isolation?|The Isolated pricing tiers provide network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps.
