Data Lifecycles:
- Data sets have unique lifecycles.
- Early in the lifecycle, data is accessed frequently, but the need for access decreases as the data ages.
- Some data remains idle in the cloud and is rarely accessed.
- Data can expire after days or months, while other data is actively read and modified throughout its lifetime.

Access Tiers:
- Azure storage provides different access tiers for cost-effective data storage.
- Available access tiers are: Hot, Cool, and Archive.
  - Hot: Optimized for frequently accessed data.
  - Cool: Optimized for infrequently accessed data stored for at least 30 days.
  - Archive: Optimized for rarely accessed data stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency requirements.

Considerations for Access Tiers:
- The access tier can be set on a blob during or after upload.
- Hot and cool access tiers can be set at the account level, while archive access tier can only be set at the blob level.
- Cool access tier has slightly lower availability but maintains high durability, retrieval latency, and throughput characteristics.
- Archive access tier stores data offline, offering the lowest storage costs but higher access costs and latency.
- Hot and cool tiers support all redundancy options, while the archive tier supports only LRS, GRS, and RA-GRS.
- Data storage limits are set at the account level, not per access tier.

Data Lifecycle Management:
- Azure Blob storage lifecycle management provides a rule-based policy for General Purpose v2 and Blob storage accounts.
- Use the policy to transition data to appropriate access tiers or expire data at the end of its lifecycle.
- The policy allows:
  - Transitioning blobs to cooler storage tiers (e.g., hot to cool, hot to archive, cool to archive) for performance and cost optimization.
  - Deleting blobs at the end of their lifecycles.
  - Defining rules to run once per day at the storage account level.
  - Applying rules to containers or a subset of blobs using prefixes as filters.

Storage Tier Recommendations:
- Consider a scenario where data is frequently accessed in the early stages but only occasionally after two weeks.
- Beyond the first month, the data set is rarely accessed.
- Recommended storage tiers based on data age:
  - Early stages: Hot storage.
  - Occasional access: Cool storage.
  - Data aged over a month: Archive storage.
- By adjusting storage tiers based on data age, you can optimize for cost and design the least expensive storage options.

The use of lifecycle management policy rules facilitates the movement of aging data to cooler tiers for the desired transition.
