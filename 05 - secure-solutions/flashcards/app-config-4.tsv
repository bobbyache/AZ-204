What encryption key is used by Azure App Configuration to encrypt sensitive information at rest?	Azure App Configuration uses a 256-bit AES encryption key provided by Microsoft.
How does Azure App Configuration manage the encryption key for each instance?	Every App Configuration instance has its own encryption key managed by the service.
What is considered sensitive information in Azure App Configuration?	Sensitive information includes the values found in key-value pairs.
What happens when the customer-managed key capability is enabled in Azure App Configuration?	App Configuration uses a managed identity assigned to the instance to authenticate with Azure Active Directory and wraps the encryption key using Azure Key Vault.
How long is the unwrapped encryption key cached within App Configuration when customer-managed key capability is enabled?	The unwrapped encryption key is cached within App Configuration for one hour.
What components are required to enable the customer-managed key capability for Azure App Configuration?	The required components are a Standard tier Azure App Configuration instance and an Azure Key Vault with the necessary features enabled, along with an RSA or RSA-HSM key within the Key Vault.
What permissions should be granted to the managed identity in the target Key Vault's access policy for customer-managed key capability?	The managed identity should be granted GET, WRAP, and UNWRAP permissions.
What is the purpose of using private endpoints for Azure App Configuration?	Private endpoints allow clients on a virtual network (VNet) to securely access data over a private link, ensuring increased security and eliminating exposure to the public internet.
What are the benefits of using private endpoints for App Configuration?	The benefits include securing application configuration details, enhancing VNet security, and securely connecting from on-premises networks using VPN or ExpressRoutes with private-peering.
What is a managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) used for in Azure App Configuration?	A managed identity allows Azure App Configuration to easily access other AAD-protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault, without the need to provision or rotate any secrets.
What are the two types of identities that can be granted to an application in Azure App Configuration?	The two types are system assigned identities and user assigned identities.
What is the difference between a system-assigned identity and a user-assigned identity in Azure App Configuration?	A system-assigned identity is tied to the configuration store and is deleted if the store is deleted, while a user-assigned identity is a standalone Azure resource that can be assigned to the store and multiple identities can be used.
How can you set up a system-assigned identity using the Azure CLI?	Use the `az appconfig identity assign` command against an existing configuration store.
How can you create and assign a user-assigned identity to an App Configuration store using the Azure CLI?	First, create the identity using the `az identity create` command, then assign its resource identifier to the configuration store.
