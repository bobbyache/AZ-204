What is feature management?	Feature management is a modern software-development practice that decouples feature release from code deployment and enables quick changes to feature availability on demand.
What is a feature flag?	A feature flag is a variable with a binary state of on or off. The feature flag also has an associated code block. The state of the feature flag triggers whether the code block runs or not.
What is a feature manager?	A feature manager is an application package that handles the lifecycle of all the feature flags in an application. The feature manager typically provides extra functionality, such as caching feature flags and updating their states.
What is a filter in feature management?	A filter is a rule for evaluating the state of a feature flag. A user group, a device or browser type, a geographic location, and a time window are all examples of what a filter can represent.
What are the components required for an effective implementation of feature management?	An effective implementation of feature management consists of at least two components working in concert: an application that makes use of feature flags and a separate repository that stores the feature flags and their current states.
How can feature flags be implemented in an application?	The basic pattern for implementing feature flags in an application is to use them as Boolean state variables with if conditional statements in the code.
What are the two parts of a feature flag?	Each feature flag has two parts: a name and a list of one or more filters that are used to evaluate if a feature's state is on.
How are multiple filters evaluated for a feature flag?	When a feature flag has multiple filters, the filter list is traversed in order until one of the filters determines the feature should be enabled. At that point, the feature flag is on, and any remaining filter results are skipped.
What is the purpose of using Azure App Configuration in feature management?	Azure App Configuration is designed to be a centralized repository for feature flags. It allows you to define different kinds of feature flags and manipulate their states quickly and confidently.
How can feature flags be accessed from an application using Azure App Configuration?	You can use the App Configuration libraries for various programming language frameworks to easily access the feature flags defined in Azure App Configuration from your application.
