What is the purpose of managed identities?	Managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage secrets, credentials, certificates, and keys used to secure communication between services.
How can services access Azure Key Vault securely?	Services can access Azure Key Vault by using managed identities, which provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure AD authentication.
What are the two types of managed identities?	The two types of managed identities are system assigned identities and user assigned identities.
How is a system-assigned managed identity enabled?	A system-assigned managed identity is enabled directly on an Azure service instance, and when enabled, Azure creates an identity for the instance in the Azure AD tenant trusted by the subscription of the instance.
What happens to a system-assigned managed identity when the associated instance is deleted?	When the instance is deleted, Azure automatically cleans up the credentials and the identity in Azure AD.
How is a user-assigned managed identity created?	A user-assigned managed identity is created as a standalone Azure resource, and after creation, it can be assigned to one or more Azure service instances.
What is the lifecycle of a user-assigned managed identity managed separately from?	The lifecycle of a user-assigned managed identity is managed separately from the lifecycle of the Azure service instances to which it's assigned.
What happens to a user-assigned managed identity when it is deleted?	A user-assigned managed identity must be explicitly deleted, and when deleted, the corresponding service principal is automatically removed.
What are managed identities internally?	Managed identities are service principals of a special type that are locked to only be used with Azure resources.
Which type of managed identity is created as part of an Azure resource and has a shared lifecycle with that resource?	The system-assigned managed identity is created as part of an Azure resource and has a shared lifecycle with that resource.
Can a system-assigned managed identity be shared?	No, a system-assigned managed identity can only be associated with a single Azure resource.
How is a user-assigned managed identity different from a system-assigned managed identity?	A user-assigned managed identity is created as a standalone Azure resource, has an independent life-cycle, and can be shared among multiple Azure resources.
What resources can be granted access using managed identities?	Managed identities can be used to give VMs, App Services, Functions, Container Instances, Azure Storage, and Azure Kubernetes Service access to any resource that supports Azure Active Directory authentication.
What is the purpose of managed identities for Azure resources?	Managed identities for Azure resources can be used to authenticate to services that support Azure Active Directory authentication.
