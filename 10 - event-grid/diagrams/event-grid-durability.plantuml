* Event Grid
** Durable Delivery
*** Tries to deliver each event at least once for each matching subscription immediately
*** Retries delivery based on a fixed retry schedule and retry policy in case of failure or non-acknowledgment
** Event Delivery
*** Delivers one event at a time to the subscriber
*** Payload is an array with a single event
*** Delivery order is not guaranteed
** Retry Schedule
*** Decision based on error type
**** Configuration-related errors may result in dead-lettering or dropping the event
**** Specific error codes not retried for Azure Resources and Webhook endpoints
**** Events without dead-letter configuration are dropped for certain errors
*** Waits 30 seconds for a response from the endpoint
**** Queues message for retry if no response received
*** Utilizes exponential backoff retry policy
*** Removes event from retry queue if endpoint responds within 3 minutes
**** Duplicates may still be received
*** Randomization and selective skipping of retries for consistently unhealthy or overwhelmed endpoints
** Retry Policy
*** Customizable when creating an event subscription
*** Maximum number of attempts (1-30, default: 30)
*** Event time-to-live (TTL) in minutes (1-1440, default: 1440)
