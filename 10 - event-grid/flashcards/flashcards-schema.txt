What are the two types of event schemas supported by Azure Event Grid?|Event Grid event schema and Cloud event schema
How many required string properties do events consist of?|Four
Are the properties common to all events from any publisher?|Yes
What does the data object in events contain?|Properties specific to each publisher
Which resource providers do the properties in the data object correspond to for system topics?|Azure Storage or Azure Event Hubs
How are events sent to Azure Event Grid?|As an array
Can the array of events posted to an Event Grid topic exceed 1 MB in total size?|No, the maximum size is 1 MB
What happens if an event or the array exceeds the size limits?|A response with the code 413 "Payload Too Large" is received
How are operations charged for events larger than 64 KB?|They are charged as multiple events in 64 KB increments
When Event Grid sends events to subscribers, how are they organized?|As an array with a single event
Where can you find the JSON schema for the Event Grid event and Azure publisher's data payload?|In the Event Schema store
What determines the data object for custom topics?|The event publisher determines the data object.
What should the top-level data in custom topics have?|The top-level data should have the same fields as standard resource-defined events.
How do subjects help subscribers in event filtering and routing?|Subjects help subscribers identify their interest and are used for filtering and routing events.
How can the path where an event occurred be used for filtering events?|Subscribers can filter events by segments of the path to narrow down or broaden their event filtering.
Give an example of using path filtering in event subjects.|A three-segment path like /A/B/C allows subscribers to filter by the first segment (/A) for a broad set of events.
What is an example of providing more detail in event subjects?|The Storage Accounts publisher uses the subject /blobServices/default/containers/<container-name>/blobs/<file> when a file is added to a container.
How can subscribers filter events for a specific container?|Subscribers can filter events by the path /blobServices/default/containers/testcontainer to receive events related to that container.
How can subscribers handle specific file types in event filtering?|Subscribers can filter or route events based on suffixes like .txt to handle specific file types.
In what formats does Azure Event Grid support events? | Azure Event Grid supports events in the JSON implementation of CloudEvents v1.0 and HTTP protocol binding.
What is CloudEvents? | CloudEvents is an open specification for describing event data.
How does CloudEvents simplify interoperability? | CloudEvents simplifies interoperability by providing a common event schema for publishing and consuming cloud-based events.
What are the benefits of the common event schema provided by CloudEvents? | The common event schema allows for uniform tooling, standard ways of routing and handling events, and universal ways of deserializing the outer event schema.
What is the difference in header values between CloudEvents schema and Event Grid schema? | The header value for content-type in the CloudEvents schema is "application/cloudevents+json; charset=utf-8," while in the Event Grid schema, it is "application/json; charset=utf-8."
What can Event Grid be used for in relation to CloudEvents schema? | Event Grid can be used for both input and output of events in the CloudEvents schema.
What can CloudEvents be used for? | CloudEvents can be used for system events like Blob Storage events and IoT Hub events, as well as custom events.
Can events be transformed during transmission using CloudEvents? | Yes, CloudEvents allows for the transformation of events back and forth during transmission.
