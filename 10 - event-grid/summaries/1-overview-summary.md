Concepts in Azure Event Grid
There are five concepts in Azure Event Grid you need to understand to help you get started:

Events - What happened.
Event sources - Where the event took place.
Topics - The endpoint where publishers send events.
Event subscriptions - The endpoint or built-in mechanism to route events, sometimes to more than one handler. Subscriptions are also used by handlers to intelligently filter incoming events.
Event handlers - The app or service reacting to the event.
